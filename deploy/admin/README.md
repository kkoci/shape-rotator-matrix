# `deploy/admin/` — operator scripts

One-shot helpers for administering the Shape Rotator Matrix deployment.
Each is invoked manually by an operator with the relevant secret in env;
nothing here runs in CI.

## `mint_token.sh` — rotate `KNOCK_APPROVER_TOKEN`

Mints a fresh access token for `@shape-rotator-2:mtrx.shaperotator.xyz`,
syncs it into both your local `.env` and the GitHub Actions secret of
the same name, then re-enables and triggers the deploy workflow.

Use when:
- The running approver is sync-401'ing (`phala logs --cvm-id dstack-matrix dstack-knock-approver-1` shows `M_UNKNOWN_TOKEN`).
- You're rotating the bot's password and need a clean device.
- A previous CVM was scrubbed and the sealed env was lost.

```bash
SHAPE_ROTATOR_2_PASSWORD='…' bash deploy/admin/mint_token.sh
```

The token is never echoed to stdout. If `/whoami` doesn't return
`@shape-rotator-2`, the script aborts before touching `.env` or the GH
secret — so a typo'd password just fails out.

## Convention

Scripts here:
- Read secrets from env vars only — no flags, no positional args, no
  files-in-repo containing values.
- Validate before mutating (e.g. `/whoami` before pushing the token).
- Are idempotent — running twice is the same as once.

## Co-admin handoff

Invite each helper's own Matrix account to the Shape Rotator space and set its
power level to 50 or higher. The helper then uses that MXID in the configured
admin room; no shared bot token is needed.

The v1 admin room is handled by the mautrix-based approver and may be encrypted.
The bot decrypts commands and encrypts replies using its persisted crypto store;
keep that store on the `/data` volume and never reuse its device ID with a fresh
store. Cleartext rooms use the same command surface.

Supported commands are `!mint`, `!codes`, `!revoke`, `!kick`, `!ban`, `!unban`,
and `!stats`. Moderation commands target the Shape Rotator space. Audit entries
remain in `/data/log.jsonl`.
