"""End-to-end test of admin commands in an encrypted room.

Covers the mautrix migration and the fail-closed admin gate: the bot
decrypts incoming `!mint` sent in an E2EE room, identifies the sender as
uncross-signed, and replies with an encrypted refusal. A separate signed-in
operator flow is required to prove the positive path.

What it asserts:
  1. A mautrix client signed in as an unverified admin user joins
     the encrypted ADMIN_COMMAND_ROOM.
  2. Sends `!mint --uses 3 admin-e2ee-test` via send_message_event
     (auto-encrypted because the room has m.room.encryption).
  3. Within ~30s, sees an encrypted refusal from @admin (the bot in this
     test stack) explaining that cross-signing verification is required.
  4. No mint URL is returned.

Env (set by run_in_runner.sh):
  DEV_HS, DEV_REG_TOKEN, ADMIN_COMMAND_ROOM, ADMIN_MXID
